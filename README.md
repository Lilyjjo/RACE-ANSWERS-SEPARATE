# RACE
Readiness Assessment for CARE Endeavour


The answers for the quizzes have been removed and relocated to their own files. Information about the quizzes' authors, links to write-ups, and high/median scores have also been added for context.

All of the included information can be found in the Secureum's [discord](https://t.co/m9fMLfXhEU), specifically in the bootcamp's discuss and announcement channels. To sign up to participate in a RACE, instructions can be found in the discord's participate channel. 


### Race Tips:
- Practice with the timer on! Half of the challenge of the RACEs is the time crunch.
- Check the length of the code snippets. If you can audit it all in ~8 mins, then reading it straight through and noting all the issues before answering is a strategy.
- If the length of the code cannot be audited in ~8 mins, go straight to the questions.
- Check to see if any of the questions are specific to a function. E.g.: "_The security concern(s) in `transferFrom` include:_". These are easier to answer correctly and are a good starting point as opposed to broader questions like "_The following issue(s) is/are present in the codebase:_".
- Note issues you see as you read the code. This can be helpful for questions like "_Security concern(s) from missing input validation(s) is/are present in:_".
